# Routing Examples

IPv6 routing examples that use [IPMininet](https://github.com/oliviertilmans/ipmininet) and are designed for helping the students who read for the [Computer Networking : Principles, Protocols and Practice](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be) ebook. Several examples are discussed in the [Networking notes blog](https://obonaventure.github.io/cnp3blog/), e.g. :

 - [Experimenting with Mininet and IPv6 routes](https://obonaventure.github.io/cnp3blog/ipmininet/)
 - [Observing IPv6 link local addresses](https://obonaventure.github.io/cnp3blog/ipv6-fe80/)
